      <div class="statueLiberty">
        <p>
          The Statue of Liberty is a 305-foot (93-metre) statue located on
          Liberty Island in Upper New York Bay, off the coast of New York City.
          The statue is a personification of liberty in the form of a woman. She
          holds a torch in her raised right hand and clutches a tablet in her
          left.
          <br />
          Statue of Liberty, formally Liberty Enlightening the World, colossal
          statue on Liberty Island in the Upper New York Bay, U.S.,
          commemorating the friendship of the peoples of the United States and
          France. Standing 305 feet (93 metres) high including its pedestal, it
          represents a woman holding a torch in her raised right hand and a
          tablet bearing the adoption date of the Declaration of Independence
          (July 4, 1776) in her left. The torch, which measures 29 feet (8.8
          metres) from the flame tip to the bottom of the handle, is accessible
          via a 42-foot (12.8-metre) service ladder inside the arm (this ascent
          was open to the public from 1886 to 1916). An elevator carries
          visitors to the observation deck in the pedestal, which may also be
          reached by stairway, and a spiral staircase leads to an observation
          platform in the figure‚Äôs crown. A plaque at the pedestal‚Äôs entrance is
          inscribed with a sonnet, ‚ÄúThe New Colossus‚Äù (1883) by Emma Lazarus.

      <div class="burjKhalifa">
        <p>
          The Burj Khalifa is a mixed-use skyscraper located in Dubai, U.A.E. It
          is the world‚Äôs tallest building, according to all three of the main
          criteria by which such buildings are judged. The Burj Khalifa was
          officially named to honour the president of the neighbouring emirate
          of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Khalƒ´fah ibn ZƒÅyid ƒÄl NahyƒÅn.The Burj Khalifa was
          built to house a variety of commercial, residential, and hospitality
          ventures. These include a hotel and luxury residences designed by
          Italian fashion designer Giorgio Armani, in addition to office space,
          observation decks, restaurants, and health facilities.
          <br />
          Burj Khalifa, Khalifa also spelled Khalƒ´fah, mixed-use skyscraper in
          Dubai, United Arab Emirates, that is the world‚Äôs tallest building,
          according to all three of the main criteria by which such buildings
          are judged (see Researcher‚Äôs Note: Heights of Buildings). Burj Khalifa
          (‚ÄúKhalifa Tower‚Äù), known during construction as Burj Dubai, was
          officially named to honour the leader of the neighbouring emirate of
          Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Khalifa ibn Zayed Al Nahyan. Although the tower was
          formally opened on January 4, 2010, the entirety of the interior was
          not complete at that time. Built to house a variety of commercial,
          residential, and hospitality ventures, the tower‚Äîwhose intended height
          remained a closely guarded secret throughout its construction‚Äîreached
          completion at 163 floors and a height of 2,717 feet (828 metres). It
          was designed by the Chicago-based architectural firm of Skidmore,
          Owings & Merrill. Adrian Smith served as architect, and William F.
          Baker served as structural engineer.

      <h3 style="color: rgb(0, 26, 77)">NIAGARA FALLS</h3>

      <div class="falls">
        <p>
          Niagara Falls, waterfall on the Niagara River in northeastern North
          America, one of the continent‚Äôs most famous spectacles. The falls lie
          on the border between Ontario, Canada, and New York state, U.S. For
          many decades the falls were an attraction for honeymooners and for
          such stunts as walking over the falls on a tightrope or going over
          them in a barrel. Increasingly, however, the appeal of the site has
          become its beauty and uniqueness as a physical phenomenon. The falls
          are in two principal parts, separated by Goat Island. The larger
          division, adjoining the left, or Canadian, bank, is Horseshoe Falls;
          its height is 188 feet (57 metres), and the length of its curving
          crest line is about 2,200 feet (670 metres). The American Falls,
          adjoining the right bank, are 190 feet (58 metres) high and 1,060 feet
          (320 metres) across.
          <br />
          The formation of the Niagara gorge (downriver) and the maintenance of
          the falls as a cataract depend upon peculiar geologic conditions. The
          rock strata from the Silurian Period (about 444 to 419 million years
          ago) in the Niagara gorge are nearly horizontal, dipping southward
          only about 20 feet per mile (almost 4 metres per km). An upper layer
          of hard dolomite is underlain by softer layers of shale. Water exerts
          hydrostatic pressure and only slowly dissolves the dolomite after
          infiltrating its joints. Dolomite blocks fall away as water from above
          infiltrates and rapidly erodes the shale at the falls itself.
