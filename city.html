      <div class="istanbul">
        <p>
          Istanbul, Turkish ƒ∞stanbul, formerly Constantinople, ancient
          Byzantium, largest city and principal seaport of Turkey. It was the
          capital of both the Byzantine Empire and the Ottoman Empire.
          <br />
          The old city contains about 9 square miles (23 square km), but the
          present municipal boundaries stretch a great deal beyond. The original
          peninsular city has seven hills, requisite for Constantine‚Äôs ‚ÄúNew
          Rome.‚Äù Six are crests of a long ridge above the Golden Horn; the other
          is a solitary eminence in the southwest corner. Around their slopes
          are ranged many of the mosques and other historic landmarks that were
          collectively designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1985.
          <br />
          Istanbul, like other major cities in the region, attracts an
          increasing number of migrants from the countryside. These migrants
          have contributed to the growth of shantytowns called gecekondu
          (literally ‚Äúset down by night‚Äù) that have no sanitation facilities and
          limited access to power and water. The Christian and Jewish minorities
          continue to shrink both in percentage of the whole and in overall
          numbers. Kurds now constitute the largest ethnic minority in the city.

      <div class="newyork">
        <p>
          New York City is located at the mouth of the Hudson River in
          southeastern New York state, which is in the northeastern section of
          the United States. New York City, officially the City of New York,
          historically New Amsterdam, the Mayor, Alderman, and Commonality of
          the City of New York, and New Orange, byname the Big Apple, city and
          port located at the mouth of the Hudson River, southeastern New York
          state, northeastern U.S. It is the largest and most influential
          American metropolis, encompassing Manhattan and Staten islands, the
          western sections of Long Island, and a small portion of the New York
          state mainland to the north of Manhattan.
          <br />
          New York is the most ethnically diverse, religiously varied,
          commercially driven, famously congested, and, in the eyes of many, the
          most attractive urban centre in the country. No other city has
          contributed more images to the collective consciousness of Americans:
          Wall Street means finance, Broadway is synonymous with theatre, Fifth
          Avenue is automatically paired with shopping, Madison Avenue means the
          advertising industry, Greenwich Village connotes bohemian lifestyles,
          Seventh Avenue signifies fashion, Tammany Hall defines machine
          politics, and Harlem evokes images of the Jazz Age, African American
          aspirations, and slums.

      <div class="rome">
        <p>
          Rome, Italian Roma, historic city and capital of Roma provincia
          (province), of Lazio regione (region), and of the country of Italy.
          Rome is located in the central portion of the Italian peninsula, on
          the Tiber River about 15 miles (24 km) inland from the Tyrrhenian Sea.
          Once the capital of an ancient republic and empire whose armies and
          polity defined the Western world in antiquity and left seemingly
          indelible imprints thereafter, the spiritual and physical seat of the
          Roman Catholic Church, and the site of major pinnacles of artistic and
          intellectual achievement, Rome is the Eternal City, remaining today a
          political capital, a religious centre, and a memorial to the creative
          imagination of the past. Area city, 496 square miles (1,285 square
          km); province, 2,066 square miles (5,352 square km). Pop. (2011) city,
          2,617,175; province, 3,997,465; (2022 est.) city, 2,761,632; province,
          4,222,631. Rome‚Äôs hot, dry summer days, with high temperatures often
          above 75 ¬∞F (24 ¬∞C), are frequently cooled in the afternoons by the
          ponentino, a west wind that rises from the Tyrrhenian Sea.
          <br />
          Since ancient times, to be a citizen of Rome has been a source of
          pride. Today there is still considerable prestige in being a Romano di
          Roma, or ‚ÄúRoman‚Äù Roman. Among such Romans are the ‚Äúblack nobility,‚Äù
          families with papal titles who form a society within high society,
          shunning publicity and not given to great intimacy with the ‚Äúwhite
          nobility,‚Äù whose titles were conferred by mere temporal rulers. The
          inhabitants who consider themselves the most nobly Roman of them all
          are the people of the Trastevere (‚ÄúAcross the Tiber‚Äù) district.
